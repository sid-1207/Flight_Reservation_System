# Flight Reservation System
---
* Flight reservation is one of the most common real-time applications which uses graphs. 
* Our aim was to create an application which will do easy routing of flights between cities and book tickets for whichever flight route the user decides to take, after viewing all the available options as well as the filtered options.
* We have tried to make this system as efficient as possible. And used multiple graph based algorithms to compute the paths.
1. Dijkstra to find the cheapest and the quickest flight. 
2. Depth first search to compute all the paths. 
3. Linked List for storing the data of the tickets that have been used.
